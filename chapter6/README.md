# Example of encapsulation
This is an example of how we can encapsulate objects in c and create an instance of that object, to create a real encapsulation we need to matain the attributes hide.
# Encapsulation
Encapsulation simply means putting related things together into a capsule that represents an object. It happens first in your mind, and then it should be transferred to the code. The moment that you feel an object needs to have some attributes and functionalities, you are doing encapsulation in your mind; that encapsulation then needs to be transferred to the code level.
