# Inheritance
An inheritance relationship can also be called an extension relationship because it only adds extra attributes and behaviors to an existing object or class.
# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is not really a relationship between two classes. It is mostly a technique for keeping the same code while having different behaviors. It allows us to extend code or add functionalities without having to recompile the whole code base.
