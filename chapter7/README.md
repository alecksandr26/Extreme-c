# Composition
To create a good composition we need to create objecs which contains as an attributes another object which from our perspective we don't know if that object exist or how it is manipulated by the main object, but when the main object it is going to be destroyed also the hided object is going to be destroyed at the same time.
# Aggregation
The Aggregation is similar to composition the difference is that the object contained by the main object has a different life timem, can be created and destroyed before or after create the main object or destroy the main object.
